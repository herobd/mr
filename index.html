    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <img src="images/img7.jpg" alt="" width="114" height="104" style="float: left; margin-right: 25px;" hidden />
    <p>I'm a coder, a researcher, an exploerer and a learner. I love to hear about and share great ideas. I pride my self on being open-minded, but grounded in my core morals. I'm a dedicated family man and an honest worker.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Where am I now?</h2>
    <p>I'm a Computer Science Masters student at Brigham Young University. I've been here for a while (begun my BS in 2008) and am getting prepared to say good bye. I should wrap up my degree by July 2016 and then it will be off to the exciting world of having a "real" job. Perhaps you're here to help me with that.</p>
    <p>I've been doing research related to computer assisted transcription of historical documents. My thesis is focused on an application of word spoting to transcription.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <img src="images/sarahandi.jpg" alt="" width="114" height="114" style="float: left; margin-right: 25px;" hidden />
    <p>I grew up in the Seattle, WA area till heading to college in Utah. I started at BYU in 2008 and left on a volunteer two-year, full-time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Since returning, I've finished my BS in Computer Science in 2013. I met my beautiful wife whom I married immediately following our graduation. We now have a wonderful little daughter.</p>
    <p>I love to hike in the mountains around Provo and on the red rocks of southern Utah. I love to sing</p>
