    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <img src="images/img7.jpg" alt="" width="114" height="104" style="float: left; margin-right: 25px;" hidden />
    <p>I'm a coder, a researcher, an explorer and a learner. I love to hear about and share great ideas. I pride myself on being open-minded but grounded in my core morals. I'm a dedicated family man and an honest worker.</p>
    <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Where am I now?</h2>
    <p>I'm a Computer Science Masters student at Brigham Young University. I've been here a while (I began my BS in 2008) and am planning to stay for a PhD. So I'll be here a while yet.</p>
    <p>I've been doing research related to computer assisted transcription of historical documents. My thesis is focused on an application of word spotting to transcription, particularly computer assisted transcription.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>A little about me</h2>
    <img src="images/sarahandi.jpg" alt="" width="114" height="114" style="float: left; margin-right: 25px;" />
    <p>I grew up in the Seattle, WA area until I came to Utah for college. I started at BYU in 2008 and left on a volunteer two-year, full-time mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. After returning, I finished my BS in Computer Science in 2013. I met my beautiful wife whom I married immediately following our graduation. We now have a wonderful little daughter.</p>
    <p>My favorite thing to do is hike in the mountains around Provo and on the red rocks of southern Utah. My favorite sport is Ultimate Frisbee. I love to play games of all types. In highschool I spent most of my senior year building a robot and competing in FIRST with our robotics club. As a child I <i>loved</i> LEGOs, and I still have a LEGO Mindstorms kit around for fun. I got interested in programming after fiddling with a game making program in junior high, and then took the AP CS classes offered in highschool.</p>
