        Dear Mom,<br>
        I would owe you the deepest respect merely for bringing me into the world. However, in addition to the discomfort you had and sacrifice you gave in bearing me, you spent untold hours caring, feeding, washing, holding, nurturing, teaching, comforting and watching me. Thank you for being a devoted mother to me.<br>
        Thank you for being a righteous mother, who taught me the Gospel and to choose the right. My life is filled with blessings that I would have never had if you did not not teach me. Your parenting allowed me to become who I have become. I hope you feel proud of the good job you did.
        <br><br>
        Love, your son,<br>
        Brian
