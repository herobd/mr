        The hand of a bride becomes the hand of a mother. Ever so gently she cares for her precious child. Bathing, dressing, feeding, comforting—there is no hand like mother’s. Nor does its tender care diminish through the years. <div id='auth'>—Thomas S. Monson</div>

        Dearest Sarah,<br>
        Sorry for basically coping what I gave my mom, but I packed the paper (whoops).<br>
        I am amazed at how much you have sacrificed to be Lily's mother. I know much of it are things you couldn't have ever anticipated, but I know you have never regretted it. Even after the discomfort of pregnancy, the pain of childbirth, the difficulty of caring for a newborn, dirty diapers, blow-outs, spit-up, crying, sickness, a streched and scarred body, and stresses that never end I see you take joy in being a mother. And this brings me great happiness. I see a Christ-like love in you for our daughter. Though you aren't perfect (and nobody is), you continuously care for our little one. Thank you.<br>
        I should mention that you in addition to being a magnificent mother, you are a wonderful wife. You are the light of my life.
        <br><br>
        Love,<br>
